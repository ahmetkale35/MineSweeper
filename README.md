# MineSweeper (Terminal Version)

This is a terminal-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. Players interact with the game in the command line to uncover tiles while avoiding hidden mines. The game provides proximity warnings when a player is near a mine and includes a scoring system based on the player's performance.

## Features
- **Grid-based board** with random mine placements.
- **Proximity warning** when getting close to a mine.
- **Multiple difficulty levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- **Scoring system** based on the number of tiles uncovered without hitting mines.
- **Win or lose** depending on the player's tile selection.
